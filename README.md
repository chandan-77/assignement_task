# post - AssigneMent

## Overview
A Flutter mobile application that fetches posts from JSONPlaceholder API
 and displays them in a list. Users can view post details, mark posts as read, and each post has a timer that pauses/resumes automatically. Data is persisted locally to maintain state across app restarts.

## Getting Started

A "Get Started" button at the bottom (90% screen width, blue color).

## Post List Screen

Each post row includes:

Background: light yellow for unread, white for read.

A timer icon showing a random countdown (10, 20, or 25 seconds).

## Tap on a post:

Marks it as read.

Each post timer starts when the post is visible on the screen.

Pauses if the post scrolls out of view or when navigating to the detail screen.
